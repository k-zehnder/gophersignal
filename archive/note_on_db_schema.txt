You're correct, and I apologize for any confusion. In your database schema, the `tags` column is indeed of type `TEXT`, but the way you are inserting data into this column is in a JSON format. Specifically, the `tags` are being inserted as a JSON array (e.g., `'["tag1","tag2"]'`), as evident from your `INSERT` statement.

Here's what's happening:

- **Database Schema**: The `tags` column in your `tasks` table is defined as `TEXT`, which means it can store any arbitrary text string.

- **Data Insertion**: When you insert data into the `tasks` table, you are storing the `tags` as a JSON-formatted string (e.g., `'["tag1","tag2"]'`). This means that, although the database column is of type `TEXT`, the actual content you are storing in this column is a string that represents a JSON array.

- **Data Retrieval and Parsing**: When you retrieve this data in your Go application, you fetch the `tags` column as a string (since it's a `TEXT` column in MySQL). However, since you know that this string is actually a JSON array, you use `json.Unmarshal` to parse this string back into a Go slice of strings (`[]string`).

So, in your Go application, you are treating the `tags` data as a JSON array, even though it's stored as a `TEXT` type in the database. This approach allows you to easily store and retrieve structured lists of tags in a single database column.
