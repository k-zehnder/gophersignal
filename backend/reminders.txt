1. need to run docker-compose up -d --build --remove-orphans on reboot

2. This is how you find the host for the MYSQL_DSN needed for prod (i think because of snap version of docker):

docker inspect -f '{{range.NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' CONTAINER_ID 

3. Sometimes I have had issues when I reboot that require me to change back and forth in prod the MYSQL_DSN from XXX.XXX.XXX:3333 to mysql:3333. 

4. Also / && /backend both have idential .env's but that needs to be fixed so just one of them has it.
